	-Woke late, started after shower and late breakfast
	-Double while-loop to put a pixel grid on the screen (every 100 pixels)
	-Converted pixel grid loop to 48 iterations instead of 480,000 (800x600)
		^This was done by using "counter += 100" instead of "counter++"
	-Converted reticle to take x and y centre coordinates
	-There is no single guiding principle governing the use of semicolons in C++:
